<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The final project is based on the Pokémon game, it is a text-based computer game.
basically you need to move around of the map and make sure if you are in the Grass section 
and write the command "catch" in order to capture a Pokémon.

By default, you have 10 pokeballs, and your first Pokémon is a pikachu, you can use a pikachu to make battles 
and capture a Pokémon when it is weakened. 
To move for the map you need to use cardinal points "east", "west", "north" and "south".
